Why Scikit-Learn for machine learning?

Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn, is Python’s premier general-purpose machine learning library. While you’ll find other packages that do better at certain tasks, Scikit-Learn’s versatility makes it the best starting place for most ML problems.

It’s also a fantastic library for beginners because it offers a high-level interface for many tasks (e.g. preprocessing data, cross-validation, etc.). This allows you to better practice the entire machine learning workflow and understand the big picture.

What's the difference between model "families" and actual models?

A "family" of models are broad types of models, such as random forests, SVM's, linear regression models, etc. Within each family of models, you'll get an actual model after you fit and tune its parameters to the data.
